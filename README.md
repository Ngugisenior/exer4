Create a program that accepts a score of a test and determines the grade based on the range of scores.

EXAMPLE:
      The test score is 68, the grade is 3.

the program displays the grade with number as a text too.
take care not to urn the score limits permanently into the program.

STEPS:
      1. Declare the variables score,function Grader() and int MinScore and MaxScore
      2. We then generated a random number and iniitialized it as the score
      3. Proceeded to write an if loop for grading with respect to the generated score.
